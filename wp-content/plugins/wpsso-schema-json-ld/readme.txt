== Description ==

<!-- about -->

<h3 class="top">This add-on has been discontinued / deprecated:</h3>

The <code>&#91;schema&#93;</code> shortcode was migrated to a new WPSSO Schema Shortcode add-on.

All other features of the WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup (aka WPSSO JSON) add-on were integrated in the [WPSSO Core v9.0.0 plugin](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/?section=changelog).

**The WPSSO JSON Premium version remains available and supported:**

* If you are using the Free / Standard version of WPSSO Core, you can safely update and continue using the **WPSSO JSON Premium** add-on.

* If you are using the WPSSO Core Premium version, you can deactivate and delete the **WPSSO JSON Premium** add-on (as all of its features are now available in the WPSSO Core Premium plugin).
